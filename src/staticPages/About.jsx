              Ever since discovering experience design during my Sophomore year at Dartmouth College,
              I have been passionate about solving for the user experience at the heart of every problem.
              I am particularly fascinated by the overlap of people and technology,
              which led me to pursue a major in Cognitive Science focused in Human-Computer Interaction
              and minors in Human-Centered Design and Digital Arts.
              <br /><br />
              In my free time, I find myself constantly making things‚Äîwhether that is testing a new dessert recipe,
              painting something from Pinterest that inspired me, or pursuing my latest VR endeavor. More than anything,
              I am driven by curiosity and a love of learning new things.
